                Definition of pollution.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into a natural environment<br>
                that causes instability, disorder, harm or discomfort to the ecosystem.

            </p>
            <h2>Types of pollution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Air pollution</li>
                <li>Water pollution</li>
                <li>Soil pollution</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>1. Air pollution.</h2>
            <p>
                Air pollution is the release into the atmosphere of various gases,<br>
                finely divided solids, or finely dispersed liquid aerosols at rates that<br>
                exceed the natural capacity of the environment to dissipate and dilute or absorb them.<br>
                These substances may reach concentrations in the air that cause undesirable health, economic,<br>
                or aesthetic effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most air pollution comes from energy use and production. Burning fossil fuels releases gases and<br>
                chemicals into the air. And in an especially destructive feedback loop, air pollution not only contributes<br>
                to climate change but is also exacerbated by it. Air pollution in the form carbon dioxide and methane raises<br>
                the earth’s temperature. Another type of air pollution is then worsened by that increased heat: Smog forms when<br>
                the weather is warmer and there’s more ultraviolet radiation.

            <h2>2. Water pollution.</h2>
            <p>
                Water pollution is the release of substances into bodies of water that makes water unsafe for human use and disrupt<br>
                aquatic ecosystems. Water pollution can be caused by a plethora of different contaminants, including toxic waste,<br>
                petroleum, and disease-causing microorganisms.

            </p>
            <p>
                Human activities that generate domestic sewage and toxic waste cause water pollution by contaminating water with<br>
                disease-causing microorganisms and poisonous substances. Oil spills are another source of water pollution that have<br>
                devastating impacts on surrounding ecosystems.

            </p>

            <h2>3. Soil pollution.</h2>
            <p>
                Soil Pollution refers to anything that causes contamination of soil and degrades the soil quality. It occurs when<br>
                the pollutants causing the pollution reduce the quality of the soil and convert the soil inhabitable for microorganisms<br>
                and macro organisms living in the soil.

            </p>
            <p>
                Soil contamination or soil pollution can occur either because of human activities or because of natural processes.<br>
                However, mostly it is due to human activities. The soil contamination can occur due to the presence of chemicals<br>
                such as pesticides, herbicides, ammonia, petroleum hydrocarbons, nitrate, etc in excess amount.

            </p>
            <p>
                The primary cause of soil pollution is a lack of awareness in general people. Thus, due to many different human<br>
                activities such as overuse of pesticides the soil will lose its fertility. Moreover, the presence of excess chemicals<br>
                will increase the acidity of soil thus degrading the soil quality. This will in turn cause soil erosion. This soil<br>
                erosion refers to soil pollution.
