            <h2>The advantages of protecting the Environment.</h2>
            <p>
                It is critical to protect the environment so as to reduce the destruction of eco-systems caused by
                a myriad of anthropogenic activities. It is more of a moral obligation for humans to protect the
                environment from pollution and other activities that lead to environmental degradation. Importantly,
                environmental degradation is detrimental since it threatens the long-term health of the animals,
                humans and plants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some reasons why humankind should save the environment or at least be environmentally conscious.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. <span class="company">The environment is effective in generating successful food chain:</span>  The sun provides light for
                    the plants. The plants are food for the animals that are in turn consumed by other animals. Therefore,
                    destroying the environment would destroy the food chain system.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. <span class="company">The trees that are a significant part of the environment helps in keeping the climate cool:</span>
                trees play a significant role in creating shades on the ground. Urban trees help buildings stay cool, reducing the need
                for electric fans or air conditioners, while large forests can tackle daunting tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. <span class="company">Many animals need the environment for survival:</span>As the environment gets destroyed,
                the more animals in the ecosystem perish. As the environment is degrading, most of the animal species face extinction.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. <span class="company">Maintaining the environment slows down global warming:</span>Deforestation adds more carbon
                and carbon dioxide that capture and absorb heat, thus speeding up the process of global warming by making the Earth hotter.
                The forest slows this process down because carbon dioxide is stored in the trees and also converts it to the oxygen.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. <span class="company">The forest gives us clean air:</span>The air we breathe is less harmful to us because the
                forest trees act as a natural filter to remove the harmful particles.

            </p>
            <p>
                6. <span class="company">Environmental protection promotes economic stability:</span>Many people are employed because
                of the forest and millions of jobs would be lost without it. The forests simply provide energy and are a source of
                livelihood for many.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. <span class="company">Protecting the environment make us happy:</span>Millions of people head to the forest to
                find relaxation and renew their spiritual energy. It has also been scientifically proven that the natural elements
                of the forest can serve as a remedy for emotional and mental distress.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. <span class="company">Environmental protection encourages better physical health:</span>The quality of air found
                in the forest can help to improve lung health and there are many recreational activities to be found there as well.
                 For example, taking a walk through the forest enhances ones physical endurance.
            </p>
            <P>
                9. <span class="company">Environmental protection reminds us to appreciate the beauty of nature:</span>There is
                nothing quite like spending time in the forests to sightsee and enjoy a day filled with surprises that only nature
                can afford. The visual splendor of the forest is one of the things that make the Earth especially stunning and unique.
            </P>
            <p>
                10. <span class="company">Protecting the environment increases tourism:</span>Many societies have benefited from
                funding, support and economic revitalization through tourism. Tourists are mainly attracted to areas such as
                forests and zoos which are all part of our environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                11. <span class="company">Medicines can be found throughout the forests and environment:</span>Medicines are
                found in the forest that can be used for a wide variety of health disorders. Medicines can be extracted to
                cure infections and a myriad of health problems.
